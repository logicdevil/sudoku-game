#sudoku-game
Actually - this's not a game. It's rather a program that solves them (Sudoku). 
But it has methods, that check whether you enter incorrect numbers or an incorrect sequence. So you can enter some numbers in some fields, then complete all of the Sudoku and after clicking 'enter' you will receive a message if you entered some digits in the wrong places. 
In fact, this program was created to solve one 'the most complex Sudoku in the world'. Thus, you can manually enter numbers from your Sudoku, press 'enter' and get a solution.
